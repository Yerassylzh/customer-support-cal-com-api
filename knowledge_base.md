How appointments work

- Booking: Patients can book by phone, at reception, or via the WhatsApp virtual assistant. For most issues we start with an exam or consultation (for example, New patient exam, Check‑up, Orthodontic consultation, Oral surgery consultation, or Emergency visit). Complex treatments are then scheduled afterwards.
- Which dentist:
  - Routine exams and cleanings: any available general dentist or hygienist.
  - Braces and aligners: orthodontist.
  - Surgical issues and wisdom teeth: oral surgeon.  
     The booking confirmation always states which doctor the patient will see.
- Typical visit length: usually 30–60 minutes, depending on the service.

Preparing for a visit

- Check‑ups/cleanings: brush and floss as normal; bring a list of regular medications and insurance details if you have them.
- Whitening: teeth should be healthy and recently cleaned; avoid strong‑staining food and drinks (coffee, tea, red wine, dark sauces) for 24 hours before and after treatment. Mild sensitivity for 24–48 hours is possible.
- Ortho/surgery consults: bring any recent X‑rays or dental reports if available; mention important medical conditions or blood thinners.

Emergency and urgent problems

- Contact us promptly for strong or worsening toothache, facial or gum swelling, broken or knocked‑out teeth, or bleeding that will not stop.
- For difficulty breathing, rapidly spreading swelling, or very high fever with dental pain, patients should go to emergency medical services immediately rather than waiting for a dental appointment.

Cancellations and rescheduling

- Patients can cancel or move appointments at any time by phone, WhatsApp or by replying to reminder messages.
- There is currently no cancellation fee, but we appreciate early notice so the slot can be offered to someone else.
- If a patient is running late, they should inform us; we will try to see them the same day, but the visit may need to be shortened or rescheduled.

Payment and insurance

- We accept cash and major bank cards.
- Some treatments may be partly reimbursed by insurance; we provide receipts and basic documentation if needed.
- For large treatment plans (such as orthodontics or implants), we always provide a written cost estimate before starting.

Quick answers

- Check‑ups are usually recommended every 6–12 months, but the dentist may suggest a different interval.
- We treat children for check‑ups, cleanings and simple treatments; complex cases may be referred to a paediatric specialist.
- Nervous patients are welcome; we can explain each step and use numbing options to keep them comfortable.
- If a patient is unsure what they need, a New patient exam or Check‑up is a good starting point; the dentist will then recommend suitable options.
